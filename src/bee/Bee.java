/**
 * The base class for all the different types of bees.  All bees have a role that
 * identified them, e.g. a drone who mates with the queen, the royal queen herself,
 * and the worker bees.  Each bee when created gets a unique ID that starts at 1
 * (the queen bee).  This allows us to uniquely identify each bee.  This class
 * uses the factory method pattern to create a bee, so the caller does not
 * need to be aware of the subclass constructors.  For example, to create
 * a pollen worker bee (assume beeHive is the bee hive):<br>
 * <br>
 * <tt>Bee.createBee(Bee.Role.WORKER, Resource.POLLEN, beeHive)</tt><br>
